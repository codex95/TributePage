        <!--Quote from someone famous about tribute-->
        <blockquote>
          <p class="quote">
"I have studied him – the wonderful man and in my opinion far from being an anti-Christ, he must be called the Savior of Humanity.
I believe that if a man like him were to assume the dictatorship of the modern world he would succeed in solving its problems in a way that would bring it the much needed peace and happiness.""
          </p>
